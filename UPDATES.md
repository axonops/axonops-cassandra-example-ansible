## Usage Examples

### Enable SSL/TLS
```bash
# Enable with default settings
make enable-ssl CLUSTER=prod-001

# Enable with custom settings
make enable-ssl CLUSTER=prod-001 -e "ssl_internode_encryption=all enable_client_encryption=true"
```

### Backup and Restore
```bash
# Create backup
make backup-cluster CLUSTER=prod-001

# Restore from backup
make restore-cluster CLUSTER=prod-001 -e backup_timestamp=2024-01-15_1430
```

### Performance Tuning
```bash
# Auto-tune based on hardware
make tune-performance CLUSTER=prod-001

# Apply specific profile
make tune-performance CLUSTER=prod-001 -e workload_profile=read_heavy
```

### Health Monitoring
```bash
# Run health checks
make monitor-health CLUSTER=prod-001

# Custom thresholds
make monitor-health CLUSTER=prod-001 -e "thresholds={'heap_usage_percent': 90}"
```

### Disaster Recovery
```bash
# Assess cluster state
make disaster-recovery CLUSTER=prod-001

# Rebuild failed datacenter
make disaster-recovery CLUSTER=prod-001 -e "dr_mode=rebuild failed_dc=dc2"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always run pre-flight checks before deployment:**
   ```bash
   make pre-flight CLUSTER=prod-001
   ```

2. **Enable SSL in production environments:**
   ```bash
   make enable-ssl CLUSTER=prod-001
   ```

3. **Schedule regular backups:**
   ```bash
   # Add to cron
   0 2 * * * cd /path/to/ansible && make backup-cluster CLUSTER=prod-001
   ```

4. **Monitor cluster health regularly:**
   ```bash
   # Add to monitoring system
   */15 * * * * cd /path/to/ansible && make monitor-health CLUSTER=prod-001
   ```

5. **Keep troubleshooting guide handy:**
   - Review TROUBLESHOOTING.md for common issues
   - Update with your own findings

## Migration Path

For existing deployments, follow this upgrade path:

1. Update the repository:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. Run pre-flight checks:
   ```bash
   make pre-flight CLUSTER=prod-001
   ```

3. Create a backup:
   ```bash
   make backup-cluster CLUSTER=prod-001
   ```

4. Enable new features gradually:
   - Start with health monitoring
   - Enable SSL if needed
   - Configure automated backups
