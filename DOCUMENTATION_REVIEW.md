## Recommendations for Users

1. **Always run pre-flight checks** before deployment:
   ```bash
   make pre-flight CLUSTER=prod-001
   ```

2. **Review example files** in:
   - `group_vars/*/all/vault.yml.example`
   - `host_vars/*/cassandra-*.yml.example`

3. **Use the Makefile** for all operations - it handles the complexity

4. **Keep TROUBLESHOOTING.md handy** during operations

## Documentation Best Practices Applied
